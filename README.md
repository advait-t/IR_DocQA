# Lecture QA Bot for Better Learning

This is a QA bot for my CSCI566 lecture at USC. This bot is based on the RAG Architecture. The lecture transcripts are stored in a VectorDB built on Meta FAISS.

Link to access it: https://ir-lec-bot.streamlit.app

The lecture transcripts are of each class in my Spring 2024 semester. About 15 lectures worth 50-60hrs are used.
